                        A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears

                        Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they 
                        provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair).

                         desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo.
